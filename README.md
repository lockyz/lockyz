### DismonDB
The DismonDB is a node.js module that allows you to show information on all the Types in the Pokemon Games.

It was originally created to give me access to information the available Pokemon APIs did not contain for the use in my own Discord Bots. While not actively worked on, I have MAJOR plans for this bot.
